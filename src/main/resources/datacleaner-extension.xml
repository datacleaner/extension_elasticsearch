	<name>Elasticsearch indexing and searching</name>
	<description>Searching reference data is a critical discipline in data quality applications. This is an extension that allows you to build and search a index on a ElasticSearch machine/cluster. Although the focus is on data quality applications, the extension can technically be applied to any situation where you need batch indexing and batch searching using ElasticSearch.</description>
